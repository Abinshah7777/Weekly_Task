# JavaScript Day 1 – Coding Tasks

## 📌 Overview

This project contains basic JavaScript programs created as part of **Day 1 – JavaScript Fundamentals** practice.

The tasks focus on understanding core programming concepts using simple and clear logic.

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used

The following JavaScript concepts were used in this project:

* **Variables** (`let`)
* **Data Types** (Number, String)
* **Operators**

  * Arithmetic operators (`+`, `*`)
  * Comparison operators (`>=`)
  * Logical operators (`&&`)
* **Conditional Statements** (`if`, `else if`, `else`)
* **Loops** (`for`, `while`)
* **Console Output** (`console.log()`)

## 🧪 Program 1: Largest of Three Numbers

### 🔹 Description

This program compares three numbers and prints the largest among them using conditional statements.

### 🔹 Sample Input

```js
let a = 10;
let b = 25;
let c = 15;
```

### 🔹 Sample Output

```
25 is the largest
```

## 🧪 Program 2: Table Generator

### 🔹 Description

This program generates a multiplication table for a given number using loops.

### 🔹 Sample Input

```js
let num = 5;
```

### 🔹 Sample Output

```
5 x 1 = 5
5 x 2 = 10
5 x 3 = 15
...
5 x 10 = 50
```

## ✅ Conclusion

These programs helped reinforce basic JavaScript concepts such as decision-making, looping, and variable usage. They form a strong foundation for understanding more advanced JavaScript topics in future lessons.
