📘 JavaScript Asynchronous Programming – Week Overview
📌 Overview

This week focused on understanding asynchronous JavaScript and how real-world applications fetch and handle external data. The learning journey covered callbacks, Promises, async/await, Fetch API, JSON parsing, error handling, and writing clean, readable logic. These concepts form the foundation for API handling in modern frontend frameworks like React.

▶ How to Run Files Using Node.js

Ensure Node.js is installed:

node -v


Save the JavaScript file (e.g., skylens.js)

Run the file using:

node skylens.js


Note: Use Node.js version 18+ for Fetch API support, or run the code in a browser console.

🌤 Mini Project – SkyLens (Async Weather App)

SkyLens is a console-based weather application that fetches real-time weather data using the Open-Meteo Public API.
The application uses the Fetch API with async/await to retrieve weather information, parses the JSON response, and displays temperature, wind speed, weather condition, and time in a formatted output.
Proper error handling is implemented using try-catch blocks to manage network or API failures gracefully.
